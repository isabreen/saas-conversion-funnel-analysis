# 📉 SaaS Conversion Funnel Analysis
**Project Type:** Product Growth / Web Analytics Case Study

## 🎯 Business Context
I analyzed user journey data for a B2B SaaS platform to identify why **only 6%** of visitors convert to paid users. This analysis serves as a roadmap for the Product team to prioritize onboarding improvements.


## 📊 The Funnel

## 🔍 Major Findings
* **The Onboarding Drop-off:** There is a **60% drop** between 'Sign Up' and 'Complete Onboarding'. 
* **The "Value" Gap:** Users are signing up but failing to reach the "Aha!" moment where they actually use the product.
* **Conversion Rate:** The total trial-to-paid conversion rate is **13.3%** (600/4500).

## 💡 Growth Recommendations
1. **Simplify Onboarding:** Reduce the number of steps required to reach "Active Usage."
2. **Personalization:** Implement "Industry Templates" during setup to make onboarding feel more relevant.
3. **Retention Nudges:** Deploy automated browser notifications for users who abandon onboarding.
